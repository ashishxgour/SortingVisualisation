# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization

This project is a web-based visualization tool for comparing the performance and behavior of five different sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Selection Sort**. Users can generate random arrays and watch as each sorting algorithm sorts the array in real-time, side by side.

## Features:

- **Five Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
- **Real-Time Visualization**: See each sorting algorithm's progress with animated bars representing array elements.
- Parallel Execution: All five algorithms run simultaneously on the same array for direct comparison.
- **Random Array Generation**: Generate a new random array with a single click.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - "Generate New Array" to refresh with a new set of random data.
  - "Start Sorting" to visualize sorting in action.

## How to Use:

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open index.html in a browser.
3.  Click "Generate New Array" to create a random array of elements.
4.  Click "Start Sorting" to watch all five algorithms run concurrently.

## Technologies:

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the sorting containers and visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for sorting algorithms and visual animations.
